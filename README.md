# likealocal

Like A Local is an application that aims to help Seattle residents connect to visitors and friends with their top recommendations by neighborhood.

This is the first full-scale Express app I wrote in Javascript with NodeJS and Postgres database.

User Story:

Anyone can browse local recommendations in Seattle by neighborhood. They're tagged and sorted by type - Day Out, Night Out, Food & Drink, etc.

If a user would like to contribute by writing recommendations, they can log in using the secure authorization system, create a profile and start posting by neighborhood.

Users can all check out the profile and photo of the user who created the recommendation on each post. 

APIs and Addons used:

BCrypt, Leaflet, Mapbox Studio, Bootstrap, Instagram API, Cloudinary

Scope/MVP:

I was successful in meeting our deliverables on time to achieve MVP for Like A Local.

-Create a functional app that can authorize users to post by neighborhood and by tag
-Allow users to upload a profile photo and store data about themselves in a profile
-See all posts by users and attach users to each post
-Use a map to showcase neighborhoods and use Instagram to show neighborhood culture

Wishlist:

-Style it up with a jQuery slidein navbar on the neighborhood show page

-Include more dynamic animation and styling on the home page

-Utilize more mobile responsive tools like modals, etc.
